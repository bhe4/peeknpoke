PeeknPoke tool is an integrated debugging tool to basically peek and poke the registers of different subsystems. The goal of this project is to present a simple command line interface to the user without any dependencies on external libraries, Linux distribution version, and platform.

Design principles

When submitting any new changes to PeeknPoke keep in mind the following design principles. The rules are simple

    Platform portability: The code should be generic without any dependecy on the Platform. Avoid hard coding the register addresses as this would break the portability.
    Linux Portability: The code shouldn't include any Android or any other third party libraries. Nor should it depend on any custom Kernel modules.

Following features are supported

    Read/Write to IO memory mapped address. Dump range of memory addresses.
    MSIC/PMIC registers read and write.
    MSR registers read and write
    I2C registers read and write
    North complex registers read and write
